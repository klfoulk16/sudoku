To use:

1. Download these lovely files.
2. If you'd like to print out your solved sudoku puzzles, run pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run python3 driver.py puzzles/puzzle1.txt in your terminal to solve puzzle1.txt
    i. A rough image of the solved and unsolved puzzle will appear.
4. If you want to see the breakdown of how long each function and line of code
takes, modify the if __name__ == "__main__": to run test() instead of main().

Looking for feedback about:
1. My project structure and whether it is readable/efficient.
2. How to make my code more pythonic.
3. How to print out a prettier picture of the sudoku puzzles
(the thick black borders are not attractive.)

This was only my second time creating a project from scratch and I know I have
a long way to go.

Future additions:
1. I will generate sudoku puzzles to solve.
2. I will finish the test.py file. I did not know about these until I was finished.
3. I will create a pygame version of this project allowing users to solve the
puzzle and ask the AI for advice.
